## clone_multilib_Slackware_repo
Clone Slackware multilib mirror to a local folder

#### Default mirror: http://bear.alienbase.nl/mirrors/people/alien/multilib/

#### Use:
```sh
$ ./clone_Slackware_multilib_JBs.sh
```

#### You can chose:
* the **Slackware version** (e.g., **14.1**, **14.2**, **current**)
* the architecture (**32** or **64** bits)
* with **md5 checksum** or not

### Enabling multilib # After the clone - download \#

#### * This procedure will also work if you already had a multilib setup and have upgraded your Slackware to a newer release (new compat32 packages will be installed and existing ones will be upgraded).

1 Open the terminal as root in the downloaded folder (e.g. 14.2)

2 You will need upgrade your 64bit Slackware gcc and glibc packages to their multilib versions by running the command below as root. This also install a new package called "compat32-tools"
```sh
# upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new *.t?z
```

3 Now you need to install 32-bit compatibility packages to support all the 32-bit programs you may want to run.
```sh
# upgradepkg --install-new slackware64-compat32/*-compat32/*.t?z
```

4 You need to reboot because of the glibc upgrade.

Done : D!

#### You can test if the all packages was installed/upgraded
> In a update of multilib, for example, or just for test. Change "Version" for the version you want to test
```sh
$ testPackagesInstalled_JBs.sh Version
```
